# Hard Drive Bay Mount

One of my friends told me they mounted their SSD in front of the operator panel. I thought it was a good idea, so I decided to take it a step further by mounting a [5.25" Hot-Swap Hard Drive Bay](https://www.orico.cc/usmobile/product/detail/id/3645) I had laying around from an old NAS project. It hijacks the opposite side of the screws that bolt the button panel's box to the rest of the cab.

The bracket closes in right after the mounting plate for this specific model to give as much space for the nut as possible, but you could theoretically modify this to support any 5.25" bay. 

## Hardware

- 8x M3x8 Truss-head Screws
- 2x M6 Nut
- 2x M6x40mm Screws
  - These replace the screws that bolt the button panel's box to the rest of the cab to give more length for an M6 nut.
