# Card Reader Mount

My FX came with card readers, but they didn't include the original box. I modeled some mounts to make them float below the visualizers because I thought it looked cool. As with most of these models, they hijack some screw holes I found to avoid using adhesive or drilling holes.

## Hardware

- 8x M4x6x6 Heat Set Insert
- 4x M4x10 Black Countersunk Screw
- 4x M4x8 Black Truss-head Screw
- 2x M4x30 Black Truss-head Screw
